<p>
    This is my favorite because I like Nari's (the protagonist of the story) character development. I also enjoyed seeing the journey
    that made her become the person who she is. Not to mention the power of their friendship !

<h3>Seasons of Blossom</h3>

<p>
    I very like the art style as well as the story ! The dialogues are just too perfect I can't handle it ! The emotions were properly
    coveyed which made me feel and enjoy reading every episode of it !

<h3>Maybe Meant To Be</h3>

    The main characters' relationship is just so cute and innocent that my heart flutters too. Even the side couple in the webtoon
    has a cute chemistry with each other !
