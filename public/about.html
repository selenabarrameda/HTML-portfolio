<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm currently a college student taking up BS Statistics, studying at the University of the Philippines Los Banos.
  I am currently studying Web Development because I think it is awesome to build a website that I created my own. I think it is also
  very fun to design! Let me share that I made my own personal card for an assignment when I was in 6th grade (probably 2015) using only
  MS powerpoint. I was and is still very proud of the design I created. Then the succeeding years, I learned how to use Adobe Photoshop 
  (which I thought was very complicated to use), and recently started using Canva too! My designs are mostly cute and minimalistic :>

  As for my hobbies, I like to bake pastries. I also enjoy listening to music (especially K-pop!) and I sing too! When
  I am inspired, I express my feelings by creating songs. It is also my fancy to watch anime and K-dramas, as well as reading
  manga and webtoon. I also started reading some self-help books when the Covid-19 Pandemic happened and started to do some self-care more :>

  If I were to describe myself, I would say that I am a shy person but would also like to come out of her shell. I am not rushing
  myself to change overnight, but I do take baby steps from time to time. Without pressure, I still learn from my everyday experiences
  and so far, I am enjoying it :>
